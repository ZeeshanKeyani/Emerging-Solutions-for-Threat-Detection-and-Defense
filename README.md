## 🌐 What is the Cybersecurity Ecosystem?

A **cybersecurity ecosystem** is an integrated framework of technologies, policies, and practices that work together to protect digital assets. Rather than relying on one solution (like antivirus or a firewall), organizations use a **layered approach** to cover:

- Network security  
- Application security  
- Cloud security  
- Endpoint protection  
- Identity and access management  
- Threat detection and response  

The ecosystem ensures **end-to-end protection**, reducing blind spots and strengthening resilience.
